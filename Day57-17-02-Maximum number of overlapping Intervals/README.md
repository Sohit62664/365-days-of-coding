📌 Maximum Number of Overlapping Intervals
🧩 Problem Statement

You are given an array of intervals arr[][], where each interval is represented by two integers [start, end] (inclusive).
Return the maximum number of intervals that overlap at any point in time.

🔹 Examples

Input:
arr = [[1, 2], [2, 4], [3, 6]]
Output: 2

Input:
arr = [[1, 8], [2, 5], [5, 6], [3, 7]]
Output: 4

🔹 Constraints

2 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 2 * 10^4

1 ≤ arr[i][0] < arr[i][1] ≤ 4 * 10^6
